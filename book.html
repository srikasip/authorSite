		<p>Enter the magical world of 1670s. Traders are flocking to Madras, the world trade center, seeking the inimitable textiles. Bales of eye-popping hues and limited quantities of delicate ‘under-wears’ for the upper classes are leaving Madras shores by shiploads.Watch the second sons of Barons, Dukes and Lords board Indiamen alongside sailors and traders as the ship sails away from a desolate, plague-torn London, consumed by the great fire. The East India Company sends it’s best and brightest to snap up bargains, rewarding them with titles, hierarchies; constraining them simultaneously with strict administrative rules.</p>
		<p>Not just the English East India Company, but also the Dutch and the French East India Companies are vying for spices and cloth – each trying to establish sole trade privileges with the multiple kingdoms and the mighty maharajas.  Connect with Iranians, Moors (Mussalmans), Sephardi Jews, Armenians, Portuguese, Gentues (Gentiles/Hindus), English and Frenchmen as they make Madras their home, and trade in the colorful bazaars outside the fledgling English Fort St. George. A handful of enterprising English ladies too are captivated by the allure of the bewitching market. Watch them all haggle and trade in a babble of world tongues, in the common language of business.</p>
		<p>Meet the weavers, the dyers, the washermen, the “painters” and the Chief Merchants. These are the men and women who make the wheels of commerce turn.   Welcome to villages that existed four centuries ago. Walk for a while in the steps of people faced with the quandary of changing times. Then as now, observe that making choices between the old and new is never an easy path.</p>
		<p>Experience centuries of crisscrossing currents between human ambition and hunger for power.  Engage in challenges, battles, wars:  the standard scripts for history. Marvel at tender shoots of love emerging in the most unlikely places. Encounter Danger. Take Risk. Discover the source of opulent wealth adorning the Nawabi durbars and royal palaces. Join the stampede of zealous seekers on the banks of River Krishna, intent on possessing the biggest and best diamonds that literally sit under the surface of the red Golconda soil. You may be the one to discover the 186 carat Koh-i Nūr, the 787 carat Great Mogul Diamond, the 340 carat Nizām Diamond, or the 115 carat, blue Hope Diamond… Who can say? Find it, smuggle it through “interlopers”, and it’s yours… forever.</p>
		<p>Gaze into this crucible of exotic excitement where extraordinary characters are created – their lives intersecting in surprising ways, creating bonds and outcomes that will outlast time. Meet remarkable men like Elihu Yale, who touched three continents in his life, at a time when the fastest mode of known transport was the horse, the palanquin or the ship at the mercy of its sail-wind. Greet exquisite women brimming with beauty, grace and passionas they drive the ambitions of their men, and when thwarted, see them rise in awesome fury, a fusillade of envy blinding their gentle ways.</p>
		<p>Homeward bound? Tarry a while in Siam: soak in the history and let the sparkle of rubies and emeralds amaze you. More adventure? Onwards to the brave new world of America…  Encounter men toiling in harsh conditions to eke out a living, the zeal of their religious fervor burning bright.  Engage in their daring dreams.</p>
		<p style="margin:0;padding:0;"><i>“All the world's a stage,</i></p>
		<p style="margin:0;padding:0;"><i>And all the men and women merely players;</i></p>
		<p style="margin:0;padding:0;"><i>They have their exits and their entrances,</i></p>
		<p style="margin:0;padding:0;"><i>And one man in his time plays many parts...</i></p>		
		<p style="margin-top:20px;">Centuries after the men and women you meet in these pages have exited the world stage, you can still reach out and touch something of magnificence; something that they endeavored to build together: a monument of consequence beyond their wildest dreams.</p>
		<p style="margin:0;padding:0;">Revel in the miracle that owes its existence to all three continents;</p> 
		<p style="margin:0;padding:0;">blessed to stand as long as the pyramids do… </p> 
		<p style="margin-top:20px;">Enjoy the journey.</p>
